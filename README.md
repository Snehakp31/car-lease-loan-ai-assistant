## Problem Statement
Car lease and loan contracts are long and difficult for users to understand. Many users are unaware of the interest rates, hidden penalties, and whether the deal offered by the dealer is fair. This lack of clarity makes negotiation difficult.

## Solution
This project provides an AI-based assistant that allows users to upload car lease or loan contracts. The system extracts key contract details, summarizes them in a simple format, and helps users negotiate better deals.

## SLA Fields to Extract
The following key fields will be extracted from car lease or loan contracts:

- Interest Rate (APR)
- Lease Term (in months)
- Monthly Payment Amount
- Down Payment
- Mileage Limit
- Penalties / Late Fees
- Early Termination Clause

These fields are fixed for the initial version of the project and will be used for contract analysis and negotiation assistance.
